## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
One challenge was trying to understand the code from the lab project and applying it to this trivia game. It took me some time to figure out how everything connected. I also got stuck when I tried to add true/false questions, but the API only gave me multiple choice options, so I wasn’t sure how to include both.

I did add a cool feature using UIAlertController() to pop up the correct answer after each question. It’s something I’ve seen in a lot of apps, so I’m really glad I got to learn how to do it myself!
